# Northcoders News Front-End

This repository serves the front-end for Northcoders news - a news aggregate website - built in React, using Reach Router. The users are able to vote on articles and comments, and also have discussions. 

 This Front End uses Axios to make requests and relies on a Back-End API, which can be found [here](https://rajinder-presenting-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api/) on Heroku.

 A live deployment of the frontend can be accessed [here]
